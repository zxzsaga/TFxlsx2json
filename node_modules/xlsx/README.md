# xlsx

Currently a parser for XLSX files.  Cleanroom implementation from the ISO 29500  Office Open XML specifications.

This has been tested on some very basic XLSX files generated from Excel 2011.

If you need something that is not currently supported, file an issue and attach a sample file.  I will get to it :)

## Installation

In node:

    npm install xlsx

In the browser:

    <script lang="javascript" src="/path/to/jszip.js"></script>
    <script lang="javascript" src="/path/to/xlsx.js"></script>

## Tested Environments

 - Node 0.8.14, 0.10.1
 - IE 6/7/8/9/10 using Base64 mode (IE10 using HTML5 mode)
 - FF 18 using Base64 or HTML5 mode
 - Chrome 24 using Base64 or HTML5 mode

## Usage

See `xlsx2csv.njs` in the bin directory for usage in node.

See http://oss.sheetjs.com/js-xlsx/ for a browser example. 

Note that IE does not support HTML5 File API, so the base64 mode is provided for testing.  On OSX you can get the base64 encoding by running:

    $ <target_file.xlsx base64 | pbcopy # the pbcopy puts the content in the clipboard

## Notes 

`.SheetNames` is an ordered list of the sheets in the workbook

`.Sheets[sheetname]` returns a data structure representing the sheet.  Each key
that does not start with `!` corresponds to a cell (using `A-1` notation).  

`.Sheets[sheetname][address].v` returns the value of the specified cell and `.Sheets[sheetname][address].t` returns the type of the cell (constrained to the enumeration `ST_CellType` as documented in page 4215 of ISO/IEC 29500-1:2012(E) ) 

Simple usage:

    var XLSX = require('xlsx')
    var xlsx = XLSX.readFile('test.xlsx');
    var sheet_name_list = xlsx.SheetNames;
    xlsx.SheetNames.forEach(function(y) {
      for (z in xlsx.Sheets[y]) {
        if(z[0] === '!') continue;
        console.log(y + "!" + z + "=" + JSON.stringify(xlsx.Sheets[y][z].v));
      }
    });

For more details:

- `bin/xlsx2csv.njs` is a tool for node
- `index.html` is the live demo
- `bits/90_utils.js` contains the logic for generating CSV and JSON from sheets
